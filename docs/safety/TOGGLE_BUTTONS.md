# EMG Robotic Arm Control - Toggle Button Implementation

## 🔄 Combined Connect/Disconnect Buttons

I've successfully combined the separate connect and disconnect buttons into single toggle buttons for a cleaner, more intuitive user interface.

## ✅ **New Toggle Button Design**

### 1. **EMG Stream Toggle Button**
- **🟢 Green "Connect to EMG Stream"** when disconnected
- **🟠 Orange "Disconnect EMG Stream"** when connected
- **Single button** that toggles between connect/disconnect states
- **Automatic state detection** based on thread status

### 2. **Robotic Arm Toggle Button**
- **🟢 Green "Connect Robotic Arm"** when disconnected
- **🟠 Orange "Disconnect Robotic Arm"** when connected
- **Single button** that toggles between connect/disconnect states
- **Automatic state detection** based on connection status

## 🎮 **User Interface Improvements**

### Before (4 buttons):
```
[Connect to EMG Stream]
[Disconnect EMG Stream]
[Connect Robotic Arm]
[Disconnect Robotic Arm]
```

### After (2 toggle buttons):
```
[Connect to EMG Stream]     → [Disconnect EMG Stream]
[Connect Robotic Arm]       → [Disconnect Robotic Arm]
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Toggle Logic
```python
def toggle_emg_stream(self):
    if self.emg_thread.isRunning():
        # Currently connected - disconnect
        self._disconnect_emg_stream()
    else:
        # Currently disconnected - connect
        self._connect_emg_stream()
```

### Dynamic Button Updates
- **Text changes**: "Connect..." ↔ "Disconnect..."
- **Color changes**: Green ↔ Orange
- **State detection**: Automatic based on connection status
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Still present for disconnect operations

## 🛡️ **Safety Features Maintained**

### All Safety Features Preserved:
- ✅ **Confirmation dialogs** for disconnect operations
- ✅ **Emergency stop** before robotic arm disconnect
- ✅ **Control stopping** before disconnections
- ✅ **State reset** after disconnections
- ✅ **Error handling** and logging
- ✅ **Thread safety** maintained

### Emergency Stop Integration:
- Still disconnects all systems completely
- Uses internal disconnect methods (no confirmation dialogs)
- Comprehensive logging of all actions

## 🎯 **Benefits of Toggle Design**

### 1. **Cleaner Interface**
- **50% fewer buttons** (4 → 2)
- **Less visual clutter**
- **More intuitive** - one button per function

### 2. **Better User Experience**
- **Clear visual state** - color indicates current state
- **Single action** - click to toggle connection
- **Consistent behavior** - same pattern for both systems

### 3. **Reduced Confusion**
- **No disabled buttons** cluttering the interface
- **Always shows current action** available
- **Immediate visual feedback** on state changes

### 4. **Maintained Safety**
- **All safety features preserved**
- **Confirmation dialogs** still present
- **Emergency procedures** unchanged

## 🚀 **Usage Instructions**

### To Connect EMG Stream:
1. Click **🟢 "Connect to EMG Stream"**
2. Button changes to **🟠 "Disconnect EMG Stream"**
3. Status shows "EMG Stream: ✅ Connected"

### To Disconnect EMG Stream:
1. Click **🟠 "Disconnect EMG Stream"**
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. If confirmed, button changes to **🟢 "Connect to EMG Stream"**
4. Status shows "EMG Stream: ❌ Disconnected"

### To Connect Robotic Arm:
1. Click **🟢 "Connect Robotic Arm"**
2. Button changes to **🟠 "Disconnect Robotic Arm"**
3. Status shows "Robotic Arm: ✅ Connected"

### To Disconnect Robotic Arm:
1. Click **🟠 "Disconnect Robotic Arm"**
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. If confirmed, button changes to **🟢 "Connect Robotic Arm"**
4. Status shows "Robotic Arm: ❌ Disconnected"

## 🎨 **Visual Design**

### Color Scheme:
- **🟢 Green**: Connect actions (safe, positive)
- **🟠 Orange**: Disconnect actions (caution, but safe)
- **🔴 Red**: Emergency stop (danger, immediate action)

### Button States:
- **Connected**: Orange background, "Disconnect..." text
- **Disconnected**: Green background, "Connect..." text
- **Always enabled**: No disabled states to confuse users

## 🔄 **State Management**

### Automatic State Detection:
- **EMG Stream**: Based on `emg_thread.isRunning()`
- **Robotic Arm**: Based on `robotic_arm.is_connected()`
- **Real-time updates**: Button state reflects actual connection status

### State Transitions:
1. **Connect**: Green → Orange, status updated, logging
2. **Disconnect**: Orange → Green, status updated, logging
3. **Emergency**: All buttons reset to green, all systems disconnected

## 🎉 **Result**

The interface is now **cleaner, more intuitive, and easier to use** while maintaining all the safety features and functionality. Users can easily see the current state and know exactly what action each button will perform.

**Perfect balance of simplicity and safety!** ✨🔄
