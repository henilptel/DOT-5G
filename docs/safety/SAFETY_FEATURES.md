  - ‚úÖ **Stops control first** if gesture detection is running
  - ‚úÖ **Resets gesture detector statistics**
  - ‚úÖ **Updates UI state** properly
  - ‚úÖ **Error handling** with logging

### 2. **Disconnect Robotic Arm Button**
- **Location**: Orange button next to "Connect Robotic Arm"
- **Function**: Safely disconnects from robotic arm
- **Safety Features**:
  - ‚úÖ **Confirmation dialog** before disconnecting
  - ‚úÖ **Stops control first** if gesture detection is running
  - ‚úÖ **Emergency stop** sent to robotic arm before disconnect
  - ‚úÖ **500ms delay** to ensure emergency stop processes
  - ‚úÖ **Resets controller state**
  - ‚úÖ **Updates UI state** properly
  - ‚úÖ **Error handling** with logging

### 3. **Enhanced Emergency Stop**
- **Function**: Complete system shutdown
- **Safety Features**:
  - ‚úÖ **Stops control** immediately
  - ‚úÖ **Emergency stop** robotic arm
  - ‚úÖ **Disconnects EMG stream**
  - ‚úÖ **Disconnects robotic arm**
  - ‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging** of all actions
  - ‚úÖ **Error handling** for each step

### 4. **Safe Application Close**
- **Function**: Graceful shutdown when closing application
- **Safety Features**:
  - ‚úÖ **Stops control** before closing
  - ‚úÖ **Disconnects EMG stream** safely
  - ‚úÖ **Disconnects robotic arm** safely
  - ‚úÖ **Logs all actions** for debugging
  - ‚úÖ **Error handling** to prevent crashes

## üéÆ User Interface Updates

### Button States
- **Connect buttons**: Enabled when disconnected
- **Disconnect buttons**: Enabled when connected (orange styling)
- **Start/Stop buttons**: Properly enabled/disabled based on connection state
- **Emergency stop**: Always available (red styling)

### Visual Feedback
- **Status labels**: Show real-time connection status
- **Button colors**: 
  - Green: Connect actions
  - Orange: Disconnect actions  
  - Red: Emergency stop
- **Log output**: Timestamped messages for all actions

## üîí Safety Workflow

### Normal Disconnect Sequence
1. **User clicks disconnect button**
2. **Confirmation dialog appears**
3. **If confirmed**:
   - Stop gesture detection/control
   - Send emergency stop to robotic arm (if connected)
   - Wait for emergency stop to process
   - Disconnect from hardware
   - Reset all states
   - Update UI
   - Log all actions

### Emergency Stop Sequence
1. **User clicks emergency stop**
2. **Immediate actions**:
   - Stop all control operations
   - Emergency stop robotic arm
   - Disconnect EMG stream
   - Disconnect robotic arm
   - Log completion

### Application Close Sequence
1. **User closes application**
2. **Automatic actions**:
   - Stop all control operations
   - Safely disconnect all hardware
   - Log shutdown completion
   - Close gracefully

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Warnings

### Confirmation Dialogs
- **EMG Disconnect**: "Are you sure you want to disconnect from the EMG stream? This will stop all gesture detection."
- **Arm Disconnect**: "Are you sure you want to disconnect from the robotic arm? This will send an emergency stop and disconnect the arm."

### Log Messages
- All disconnect actions are logged with timestamps
- Error messages are clearly marked with ‚ùå
- Success messages are clearly marked with ‚úÖ
- Warning messages are clearly marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### To Disconnect EMG Stream:
1. Click "Disconnect EMG Stream" (orange button)
2. Confirm in the dialog box
3. System will safely stop control and disconnect

### To Disconnect Robotic Arm:
1. Click "Disconnect Robotic Arm" (orange button)
2. Confirm in the dialog box
3. System will emergency stop the arm and disconnect

### For Emergency Stop:
1. Click "üö® EMERGENCY STOP" (red button)
2. System will immediately stop everything and disconnect all hardware

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Thread Safety
- All disconnect operations are thread-safe
- Proper cleanup of threads and resources
- No race conditions between connect/disconnect operations

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around all disconnect operations
- Graceful degradation if errors occur
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### State Management
- UI state is properly updated after each operation
- Button states reflect current connection status
- Statistics are reset when appropriate

## üéØ Benefits

1. **User Safety**: Clear confirmation dialogs prevent accidental disconnects
2. **Hardware Safety**: Emergency stop ensures robotic arm is safely stopped
3. **System Safety**: Proper cleanup prevents resource leaks
4. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging helps troubleshoot issues
5. **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback and intuitive button layout

The system is now **production-ready** with comprehensive safety features for both normal operation and emergency situations! üõ°Ô∏è‚ú®
